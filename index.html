    <h2>Process for this Log. (V1.1 - Updated 2020.08.16)</h2>  
      <ol>
        <li>Work through lessons pausing at ends of themes, like CSS Grid, to summarize the topic, rather than belaboring every little nugget of learning.</li>
        <li>Create an h2 headline following the previous formats, followed by as many p's as needed, wrapped in a article tag describe what the code is used for and how it works, an optionally include a single example that contains all of the arguments/attributes/properties etc. learned in this session.</li>
        <li>Put new entries below this one but above the previous.</li>
      </ol>

  <h2>2020.08.22 - Learning Importance of structure and order of operations in CSS Grid</h2>
  <p>Coded out the whole CSS Grid for the page and it had so many bugs with missing &lt;/div&gt;'s I couldn't sort them. Some were in-line and so I duplicated below enclosed elements creating multiple closing div's. Other times I did the opposite.</p>
  <p>keeping my divs organized - is critical.</p>
  <p>Also critical is to create the top level structure first and make sure it is what I'm aiming for. Then Gradually fill in the sections with the desired contents as I go so I know where the errors are coming from and don't have to debug a pile of stuff but can build right the first time...as I go.</p>
  <p>Got all of the top level css grid areas corrected. And the second level as well.</p>
  <p><strong>NEXT let's get the top level grid spacing to be the same as the example SERP so the sections fall in the correct places.</strong></p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>2020.08.21 - Re-Doing the markup with tiered levels of CSS Grid breaking into sub grids rather than multiple top-level grids.</h2>
  <p>Re-created the css grid so it starts at the highest level, for the whole page. Then will proceed to create sub-grids that will break up those grid cells into smaller ones ... IE designing the house, then where the rooms are, then the boxes in the rooms, then the content in the boxes.</p>
  <p>This should make the code more modular and therefore easier to copy+paste for repeating sections.</p>
  <p>One question I have at this point, and I'll see how I deal with it as this progresses - is how best to think about labeling the classes for these various grid-area-sections? "Top left" "Top middle" "top-Right"? For the three sections along the top? Or should I name them for what they contain?: "Google Logo", "Search bar", "Launcher and profile pic"? <strong>I will opt for naming based on location at the top level - we'll see how I feel at lower levels.</strong></p>
  <p>Next is to DEBUG the shit out of what I've done - there's some structure there but it's very definitely not working...fix it and then reflect on big picture why it wasn't happening in the first place - imagine checklists/mnemonics, things to look out for...</p>

  <h2>2020.08.21 - Fixed the CSS Grid placements</h2>
  <p>Fixed CSS placements by completing the css grid assignments... DUH.</p>
  <p>Next up need to set media quieries for larger and smaller thant 800px(?) and need to set location and grid area sizing for all current grid-areas.</p>
  <p>Then size the logo and pick what to do next.</p>

  <h2>2020.08.19 - Google SERP beginning</h2>
  <p>Marking up the SERP.</p>
  <P>Depth and quality start now.</P>
  <p>Got the top half of the Mark-up done.</p>

  <h2>2020.08.18 - Google Homepage Recreate</h2>
  <p>Assignment is to recreate the Google homepage. Not the whole functionality of course, just the page.</p>
  <p>I will be recreating the hard version, this one: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage">https://www.google.com/search?q=build+this+webpage</a></p>
  <p>Next actions will be to diagram the page on large paper marking it with expected code/elements, and then get the rest of the content up on the page, styling it afterwords.</p>

  <h2>2020.08.17 - Dev Tools</h2>
  <p>Using the dev tools links on the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/developer-tools?ref=lnav">Odin Project Lesson Page</a></p>
  <p>Learned that how to inspect elements on a page, as well as how to highlight rendered elements by selecting the html/css/etc. iteself.</p>
  <p>Learned I can edit in the inspector any elements I want and have the browser render my edited version (not uploading to the server of course).</p>
  <p>The inspector allows me to view the html and the css and to see which css properties are superior to which, ranking them from most specific to most general, relative to the element in question. This enables troubleshooting if there is a property acting superior to an other that I forgot about.</p>
  <p>There's even the ability to select from a color chart replacement colors where color is specified.</p>
  <p>Can manually adjust margin, border, padding from the diagram of those.</p>
  <p>Javascript can be inpsected with using the Event Listeners, DOM Breakpoints and Properties tabs.</p>
  <p>Console at the bottom can be fed javascript and it will run within the page itself and therefore I have access to any js functions available on the page.</p>
  <p>Use Computed to </p>
  <h3>Workflow for Using Inspector to Debug Webcode</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Edit in the inspector.</li>
    <ol>
      <li>This includes toggling on and off CSS and making changes in the "Styles" section.</li>
    </ol>
    <li>Copy and paste into my actual code.</li>
    <li>Sort from specific to general looking through the elements and CSS properties to see what is causing the styles I don't want.</li>

  <h2>2020.08.16 - New Blog Protocol and more CSS Grid</h2>
  <p>New protocol (will be updated at top as well)</p>
  <p>Original protocol (V.1):</p>
  <div class="old-reference">
    <h2>Process for this Log.</h2>
    <p>For everything I learn, create an entry here with the date, an explanation of what I learned, and also a demontration of the code <strong> including showing the code iteslf used for the demonstration of the tool or principle</strong>.</p>
    <p>Specifically create an h2 followed by as many p's as needed, wrapped in a article tag and include both a demonstration of the code in use AND a view of the code as actually written.</p>
    <p>Put new entries below this one but above the previous.</p>
    <br/>
    <textarea>Create an<article> with an<h2> and <code><p></code>'s explaining the tool or concept I've learned and
    - Demonstrate it</textarea>
  </div>
  <p>In the FreeCodeCamp CSS Grid lessons, I learned:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How to use Grid-template-Areas property to dictate not just how many rows and columns a grid has, but which cells occupy more than 1 column or row. This is effectively how you do newspaper layout for blocks in the grid. Then applied items to specific grids named in the grid-template-areas property via the grid-area property.</li>
    <li>How to use Grid-Area property to dictate this same info on-the-fly for individual items, without pre-determining the whole grid layout.</li>
    <li>To use the repeat function within the grid-template-rows OR -columns property to save time when specifying multiple columns/rows of the same size. IE <code>100px 100px 100px</code> becomes <code>repeat(3, 100px)</code>.</li>
    <li>the <code>minmax</code> function for column or row size to that rows and columns can shrink and grow with set limits as the media grows and shrinks.</li>
    <li>To use <code>auto-fill</code> to automatically add and subtract columns based on the media size.</li>
    <li><code>auto-fit</code> to automatically adjust the size of rows/columns as the media size changes.</li>
    <li>How to determine additional sets of CSS stylining based on <strong>media queries</strong>, so that different grid layouts, or other styles, can be changed when the size, type, or other attributes of the user's media change.</li>
    <li>To create <code>grids within girds</code> so that I can use a grid to determine the page layout and then within sections, further describe the layout in finer detail.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2020.08.14-15 - CSS Grid</h2>
  <p>Control how many columns a grid item in a CSS Grid will consume using: <code>grid-column</code>, which is a CSS property that applies to the grid items and <strong>not</strong> the grid itself. </p>
  <p><code>grid-column: 1 / 3;</code> makes an item stretch from the first to the third invisible line, separating all of the columns. These lines count from 1 at the top and left, upward in integers.</p>
  <p>Same goes for rows via <code>grid-row: 1/3;</code></p>
  <p>Control the left-right justification of content within a single cell via: <code>justify-self</code>. This defaults to <code>stretch</code> but will also take arguments such as: <code>start</code> (aligning content to left), <code>center</code>, and <code>end, whichi aligns content right.</code></p>
  <p>Control the up-down alignment of a single cell in the same way as above, with all the same arguments, by using <code>align-self</code>.</p>
  <p>Control the left-right justification of all cells via <code>justify-items</code> and presumably the up-down alignment via <code>align-items;</code>.</p>
  <p>Diagram and set which cells are to be merged in a CSS Grid by using <code>grid-template-areas</code>. Do this by:</p>
  <br>
  <div name=container class="css-grid-id-1-column">
    <div class="css-grid-j-start"><code>grid-template-areas:</code></div>
    <div class="css-grid-j-end"><code>"header header header"</code></div>    
    <div class="css-grid-j-end"><code>". content content"</code></div>
    <div class="css-grid-j-end"><code>"footer footer footer"</code></div>
  </div>
  <p> the above was intended to be slightly offset like the CSS code in the freecodecame.org sandbox pane. Alas I didn't pull it off. Ideally I will start here with figuring this out so that I really can use this functionality.</p>

  <h2>2020.08.13 - Gap in between Rows via CSS Grid</h2>
  <p>Use the CSS Argument: <code>grid-row-gap: 5px;</code>.</p>
  <P>The number can be relative or absolute. It will create a gap in between the horizontal rows in the CSS Grid.</P>
  <p>You can also use <code>grid-gap: 5px 10px;</code> to set both the row <strong>and</strong> the column gap at once. Row gap is set w first number, column gap with the second. One number only would set BOTH row and column gap.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>2020.08.12 - CSS Grid Columns </h2>
  <p>Add a gap between the columns by using <code>grid-column-gap: 20px;</code> declaration in CSS.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>2020.08.11 - CSS Grid columns, Rows, </h2>
  <p>Used grid-template-columns, "" rows</p>
  <p>The divs group just below this should have 3 columns.</p>
  <p>Originally I had transposed one of the px's in the CSS declaration for <code>grid-template-columns: 100<strong>xp</strong> 100px 100px;</code></p>
  <div class="css-grid">
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
    <div>3</div>
    <div>4</div>
    <div>5</div>
    <div>6</div>
  </div>
  <p>Absolute AND relative units can be used in this context to set the size of columns or rows in <code>css grid</code>. What options are used in the demonstration below this?</p>
  <div class="css-grid-units">
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
    <div>3</div>
    <div>4</div>
    <div>5</div>
  </div>
  <P><code>Auto 50px 10% 2fr 1fr</code>. In other words that's automatically the size of the content, 50px, 10% of the space, 2 "parts" where parts are the total number of parts in the container, 1 part.</P>
  <br/>
  <p>I think going forward I will cease the brand-new example for each specific line of code I learn, and instead collect questions to trigger each line of code, and at the end of a session, summarize the concept and it's capabilities.</p>

  <h2>2020.08.10 - Turns out using &lt; and &gt; IS done by writing "& lt ;" without spaces.</h2>
  
  <h3>Section 1, follow up from last entry</h3>
  <p>In order to write code without it rendering it turns out that using &lt;code&gt; is done by writing out  "& lt ;". You don't actually type out the "<'s" on either side.</p>
  <p>This is fun news because it shows that my (v low level) sleuthing actually found the correct answer and maybe shouldn't be thought of as so lowly/hacky but maybe as "oh I found an solution, maybe later I'll find a better one, but this'll do for now."</p>
  <p>Additionally, it turns out the "&lt;code&gt; really just formats text like this <code>formated by &lt;code&gt;</code></p>
  
  <h3>Section 2, Using CSS Gird - today's lesson</h3>
  <p>Enable CSS Grid by setting <code>display</code> declaration in CSS to <code>grid</code>. The next paragraph is set to grid</p>
  <p class="css-grid">This has been set to grid. Will see more in subsequent entires and will use class "<code>css-grid</code>".</p>

    <h2>2020.08.09 - troubleshooting <Code> "< code>"</Code> </h2>
    
    <p>I still need to find out how to display html code without it rendering but rather with it displaying as regular text. The above is a cute gerry-rig, but it's not the real solution.</p>  
    <p>This does have me wondering whether going down these rabbit holes is worthwhile. I am going to say, "yes" because when I solve this, I will be better at troubleshooting, and I will understand something fundamental about HTML</p>
    <p>For now I will use this hack in the <code>< h2></code> of this article and avoid this issue becuase when I copy and paste the inspected html out of w3schools.com for where they have tags rendering as text, it translates them so the carrots are no longer carrots but are these instead - &lt; and &gt; </p>
    <p>This works <Code> "< code>"</Code>.</p>
    <P>But this does not<Code> "<code>"</Code.></P>
    <p>This works      <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;span&gt;</code></p>
    <p>And of course textarea works as in the header article.</p>

      <h2>2020.08.08 - Cloning a Git Repository creates a folder of its name, in the pwd</h2>
     
      <p>When cloning a git repository from GitHub, it will come in it's own folder based on it's name. Meaning if I want this "learn-do" project to end up as a folder called "learn-d" in the "documents" folder, I need to execute the git clone command in terminal from the "documents" folder.</p>
      <p>There's no need to create a new folder for it called "learn-do" and to then clone it into that folder</p>
