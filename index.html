    <h2>Process for this blog.</h2>  
      <p>For everything I learn, create an entry here with the date, an explanation of what I learned, and also a demontration of the code <strong> including showing the code iteslf used for the demonstration of the tool or principle</strong>.</p>
      <p>Specifically create an h2 followed by as many p's as needed, wrapped in a article tag and include both a demonstration of the code in use AND a view of the code as actually written.</p>
      <p>Put new entries below this one but above the previous.</p>
      <br/>
      <textarea>Create an<article> with an<h2> and <code><p></code>'s explaining the tool or concept I've learned and
      - Demonstrate it</textarea>
  </article>
  <!--Put new entries just below this one so I have the most current log entry at the top and the oldest at the bottom
  Remember format is Article> H2, P's, textarea or similar if needed, Example.

    <h2>2020.08.09 - troubleshooting <Code> "< code>"</Code> </h2>
    <p>I still need to find out how to display html code without it rendering but rather with it displaying as regular text. The above is a cute gerry-rig, but it's not the real solution.</p>  
    <p>This does have me wondering whether going down these rabbit holes is worthwhile. I am going to say, "yes" because when I solve this, I will be better at troubleshooting, and I will understand something fundamental about HTML</p>
    <p>For now I will use this hack in the <code>< h2></code> of this article and avoid this issue becuase when I copy and paste the inspected html out of w3schools.com for where they have tags rendering as text, it translates them so the carrots are no longer carrots but are these instead - &lt; and &gt; </p>
    <p>This works <Code> "< code>"</Code>.</p>
    <P>But this does not<Code> "<code>"</Code.></P>
    <p>This works      <code class="w3-codespan">&lt;span&gt;</code></p>
    <p>And of course textarea works as in the header article.</p>

      <h2>2020.08.08 - Cloning a Git Repository creates a folder of its name, in the pwd</h2>
      <p>When cloning a git repository from GitHub, it will come in it's own folder based on it's name. Meaning if I want this "learn-do" project to end up as a folder called "learn-d" in the "documents" folder, I need to execute the git clone command in terminal from the "documents" folder.</p>
      <p>There's no need to create a new folder for it called "learn-do" and to then clone it into that folder</p>
