      <h2>A note about Git</h2>
      <p>When cloning a git repository from GitHub, it will come in it's own folder based on it's name. Meaning if I want this "learn-do" project to end up as a folder called "learn-d" in the "documents" folder, I need to execute the git clone command in terminal from the "documents" folder.</p>
      <p>There's no need to create a new folder for it called "learn-do" and to then clone it into that folder</p>
